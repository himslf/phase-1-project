                <h2>About 'Pulp Fiction'</h2>
                <p>Pulp Fiction is a 1994 crime film directed by Quentin Tarantino.
                    The film tells several interwoven stories that revolve around the
                    Los Angeles criminal underworld. The film's non-linear narrative
                    style is one of its most distinctive features, as it jumps back and
                    forth in time, presenting events out of chronological order.
                    The film features a large ensemble cast that includes John Travolta,
                    Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, and Bruce Willis.
                </p>

                <p>As Tarantino's second directorial mark, the movie's title is a reference
                    to the early 20th century book genre "pulp fiction" known for its cheap,
                    pulpy paper pages and underworld topics such as: gangsters, violence, drugs,
                    and overtly sexual (for the time) situations. Probably the most famous
                    writers from this genre were Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.

                <h2>Tarantino's Characters</h2>
                <p>Pulp Fiction features a wide range of memorable and quirky characters,
                    each with their own unique personalities and quirks. There's
                    Vincent Vega (John Travolta), a hitman who is both cool and charming,
                    but also flawed and impulsive. His partner Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson)
                    is a philosophical and imposing hitman with a penchant for quoting scripture.
                    Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) is the boss' wife, a seductive and mysterious
                    woman with a love for dancing and cocaine. The film also features Bruce Willis
                    as a disillusioned boxer named Butch Coolidge, and Harvey Keitel as a fixer
                    known as The Wolf. Each character is given ample screen time to develop their
                    own storylines, and their interactions with one another drive the film's nonlinear
                    narrative forward. The characters of Pulp Fiction have become iconic in popular
                    culture, and their influence can still be seen in modern film and television.

                <h2>Notable Scenes</h2>
                <p>Pulp Fiction is filled with many memorable scenes that have become iconic in the
                world of cinema. Here are three scenes that have left a lasting impression on audiences:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"<em>The Dance Scene</em>": One of the most memorable scenes in Pulp Fiction is when Vincent Vega (John Travolta)
                            takes Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) to Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 1950s-themed diner. The two characters showcase 
                            their dance moves on the dance floor, accompanied by Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell."
                            The scene is full of style, charisma, and energy, creating a timeless moment in the film.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>"<em>The Royale with Cheese</em>": In this scene, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield engage
                            in a conversation about burgers and the cultural differences between Europe and the United States.
                            The dialogue is sharp, witty, and laced with pop culture references, showcasing Quentin Tarantino's
                            signature style of dialogue-driven storytelling.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>"<em>The Ezekiel 25:17 Speech</em>": Jules delivers a powerful and intense speech before executing his targets.
                            Quoting the biblical passage Ezekiel 25:17, Jules's monologue is filled with righteous 'fury' and philosophical
                            contemplation. Samuel L. Jackson's performance, coupled with the impactful dialogue, has made this scene one of
                            the most quoted and iconic moments in the film.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>These scenes, among many others, have contributed to Pulp Fiction's enduring legacy and have solidified its place in cinema history.</p>

            <section id="soundtrack">
                <h2>The Score</h2>
                <p>Pulp Fiction's soundtrack is as iconic as the movie itself, featuring
                    a collection of timeless rock 'n' roll, surf rock, soul, and pop songs that
                    complement the film's non-linear storytelling and stylized violence.
                    From the opening credits with Dick Dale's "Miserlou" to the closing scene
                    with Urge Overkill's cover of Neil Diamond's "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon,"
                    the music in Pulp Fiction adds to the movie's distinct character and atmosphere.
                    The use of music to create a mood is a trademark of director Quentin Tarantino's
                    style, and the soundtrack of Pulp Fiction is often cited as one of the greatest
                    movie soundtracks of all time, inspiring countless other filmmakers to follow in
                    Tarantino's footsteps.
